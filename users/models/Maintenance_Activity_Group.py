# Maintenance_Activity_Group is a collection points for all
# maintenance activities contemplated for a single maintenance period.
# When future maintenance periods take the form of pending periods or
# electives their exact date is not known.  It is not even known if
# one will precede another.  So the system creates as many
# Maintenance_Activity_Groups as there are possible maintenance
# activity dates for that week, labeling them 'A', 'B', etc.  It is
# guaranteed that 'A' will be then attached to the earliest
# maintenance date, 'B' to the next one, etc.
#
# The following is a use case, assuming 2 maintenance days denoted by
# equal electives (date range exactly the same: Tuesday-Friday).
#
#   1) The system sees the two electives for that week.  It then
#   creates (as needed) 2 Maintenance_Activity_Groups, labeling one
#   'A' and the other 'B'.  It does nothing if they are already
#   created.  It truncates the list if the number of elective
#   maintenance electives decreased, deleting the lowest rank ('A' is
#   highest).  It increases the list if the number of maintenance
#   electives increased.  Deletions of Maintenance_Activity_Groups are
#   'soft', enabling the administrators to restore them or the
#   activities attached to them.
#
#   2) These are now be displayed on the calendar in order, on the
#   Monday of the week, where maintenance personnel can attach
#   activities to them.  They are not attached to any periods yet.
#
#   3) The scheduler schedules one of the electives.
#
#   4) The calendar notes this and attaches group 'A' to the published
#   period.
#
#   5) The scheduler schedules the second one, at a date that comes
#   after the first one.
#
#   6) The calendar notes this and attaches group 'B' to the published
#   period.
#
#       ---OR---
#
#   5) The scheduler schedules the second one, but on a date that
#   comes before the first scheduled elective.
#
#   6) The calendar notes that 'B' will come before 'A', and swaps the
#   two.  Now 'A' is attached to the earlier date, and 'B' to the
#   later date.
#
#   7) Maintenance_Activity_Groups remain attached to periods even
#   after periods are published.  This allows the calendar to maintain
#   this 'A', 'B' ... ordering even if the scheduler alters the date
#   of an already published period.

    # The model already has a 'maintenance_activity_set' attribute
    # wich can be used to access the Maintenance_Activity objects
    # associated with this group.  This code adds instances of repeat
    # activities to this set based on any repeat templates that are
    # currently active.  Repeats are added to both published and
    # unpublished maintenance activity groups.  The following lays out
    # the heuristics.
    #
    # We start out with an example of what we want, based on the following week:
    #
    #                    Week
    #   Monday    Tuedsay    Wednestay  Thurdsay   Friday     Saturday   Sunday
    # |----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
    #     'B'                 'x'                   'Ap'
    #     'C'
    #
    # 'B', 'C': floating unpublished
    # 'x'     : fixed published
    # 'Ap'    : floating published
    #
    # Note: when 'add'ing below the assumption is that it first checks
    # to ensure this hasn't already been done.
    #
    # Assigning repeats.  Here is what we want to do:
    #
    #    - Daily:   * add one to all '*p', and to 'x' if not 'Unscheduled Maintenance'.
    #                 Ensure only one per day.
    #               * add one each to 'A' and 'B'.
    #               * done.
    #
    #    - Weekly:  * See if any 'x' or '*p' fits the bill.
    #                 - Yes:  done.
    #                 - No: continue.
    #               * affix to 'A'
    #               * done.
    #
    #    - Monthly: * See if this week is due.
    #                 - Yes: Do as weekly.
    #                 - No: done.
    #
    # From the above it can be seen that we don't really deal in
    # periods here, only in maintenance activity groups.  There are 5
    # kinds of maintenance activity groups:
    #
    #    * floating unpublished
    #    * fixed unpublished
    #    * floating published
    #    * fixed published
    #    * fixed published that are emergency.
    #
    # Of those we are only interested in three:
    #
    #    * floating unpublished
    #    * fixed published, except emergency
    #    * floating published
    #
    # These can be reduced to two groups of mags by query:
    #
    #    * Ux: maintenance activity groups that have no period (remaining floating)
    #    * P:  maintenance activity groups with periods that don't belong
    #          to session "Uncheduled Maintenance".
    #
    # This reduces all the above to:
    #
    #         Week
    #   Monday    Tuedsay    Wednestay  Thurdsay   Friday     Saturday   Sunday
    # |----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
    #     'U1'                 'P'                   'P'
    #     'U2'
    #
    # This function is done from the perspective of the MAG.
    # Instantiating a template is therefore is like claiming it.  But
    # before claiming it we check to make sure no other MAG has a
    # better claim.. From the perspective of the MAG, assigning
    # repeats becomes:
    #
    #    - Daily:   * Is self a P?
    #                   - Yes: Is there another P today?
    #                            - Yes: Is other P more suitable?
    #                                     -Yes: continue;
    #                            - No: add one to self
    #                   - No: Is self a 'U'?
    #                           - Yes: add one to self
    #               * done.
    #
    #    - Weekly:  * See if any other 'P' fits the bill.
    #                 - Yes: done.
    #               * If self a 'P', is self suitable?
    #                 - Yes: add, and done.
    #                 - No: continue
    #               * If self a 'U', see if highest ranking 'U'
    #                 - Yes : add the repeat activity.
    #               * done.
    #
    #    - Monthly: * See if this week is due.
    #                 - Yes: Do as weekly.
    #                 - No: done.
    #
    # There is one final step, which is to clean up after the 'U*'
    # become published, in case two or more are published to the same
    # day as each other or another maintenance activity group which
    # has already received a repeat.  Look for MAGs on the same day.
    # If found, ensure that a particular repeat activity only shows up
    # on the appropriate MAG.
