"""Parse implements the functions for parsing a propositional logic
   proposition.

   Input syntax of propositions:
     an input proposition is a string structured according to these
     grammar rules:

   E ::=  T op T  |  T
   T ::=  -F  |  F
   F ::=  p  |  ( E )
          where  op  is any of  &, |, ->
                 p   is an alphabetic letter (or string of letters)

   All compound propositions must be bracketed with parens.
   Examples:   (p | q) & r 
               -( p -> -s )
               - ( - p )
               ((a -> (b)) )
               p
   
   These examples are incorrect because they lack adequate parens:
       p | q | r
       - -p

   Format of parsed propsition: a nested listed of this form:

   L ::=  [ op, L, L ]  |  [ "-", L ]  |  "p"
          where op is any of  "&", "|", "->"
                p  is a lower-case letter

  The nested list is a simple-minded representation of a parse tree.
  Here are the parsed nested lists corresponding to the above examples:
      ["&", ["|", "p", "q"], "r"]
      ["-", ["->", "p", ["-", "s"]]]
      ["-", ["-", "p"]]
      ["->", "a", "b"]
      "p"

tokens =  []   # holds the list of symbols in the input proposition
